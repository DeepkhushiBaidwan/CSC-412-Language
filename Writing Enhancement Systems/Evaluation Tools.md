One type of tool that many people use to help them gain feedback on their [[Writing Enhancement Systems|ability to write]] is evaluation tools. These come in many different forms and levels of complexity, but they all share a similar process and purpose - they take in a written work and provide feedback on that work. Most of the research into these tools focuses upon using them as an aid for teachers and professors marking academic papers, but they can and have been used to aid the learner.
### Examples

The simplest version of these tools are Automated Essay Scoring systems. However, these systems provide minimal feedback, and are mostly used by markers grading papers because they do not give specific or qualitative feedback. 

The next evolution of these tools is Automated Writing Evaluation tools like [Criterion]( https://criterion.ets.org/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) and [MyAccess](https://aacc.vantagelearning.com/myaccess/) These tools are learner-focused, intended to not only evaluate the student's writing but to give the learner actionable feedback about said writing. In scientific research, little distinction is made between this type of evaluation tool and [[Composition Aids]].

It is possible to consider evaluating [[Writing using AI Models]] as a further evolution of this type of tool, but there are notable differences in the feedback such AI models provide compared to other evaluation tools.
### Effectiveness

Despite the complexity of evaluating writing, systems like these can evaluate the quality of a submitted writing with high accuracy comparable to human evaluators. Because of this, these tools are primarily useful for gaining feedback about a learner's own work, and generally at a level comparable to having an actual teacher do the work. Used correctly, these tools can significantly accelerate a learner's ability to enhance their understanding of how to write, especially in academic contexts where the style and format of writing is relatively inflexible.

This type of tool focuses less on offloading the difficulty of a writing task and more on improving the level of support a writer has available to them. Even Automated Writing Evaluation tools provide writers with relatively quick, if not specific, feedback on their writing abilities presenting them with more opportunities to engage with the task of writing.
