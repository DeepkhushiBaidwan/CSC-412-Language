Tools to aid people's writing are some of the most well known digital cognitive aids. This category covers a wide breadth of differing ideas, from narrow [[Evaluation Tools|evaluation tools]] focused on evaluating academic writing to more general [[Composition Aids|composition aids]] that help people find, correct, and sometimes improve upon their writing no matter the purpose. Relatively recently, [[Writing using AI Models|AI models]] have also become a very common method of helping an individual to write, attempting to move beyond the simple feedback that other tools give and provide more context-specific guidance.

While the technologies used differ greatly, all of the tools aid the cognitive elements of writing in at least one of three major ways. Firstly, these tools can significantly reduce the cognitive load on an individual by offloading the effort needed to edit the paper onto the tool. Secondly, some tools allow the writer to focus less on the writing itself, and more on the topics they wish to present. Thirdly, some tools provide a level of scaffolding that catches and identifies missteps in writing, allowing writers [[Language_Learning_Applications|less familiar with English]] to see and hopefully understand errors that they make.
