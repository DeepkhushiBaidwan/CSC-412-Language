## Introduction

Language comprehension is a complex task that involves the real time analysis of language, either written or spoken and the linking of that stimulus to information stored in long term memory from which we derive meaning (Federmeier, 2007). One of the ways our brains model language is with situation models or integrated mental representations of situation (Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998). 
Building these mental models is a key step towards comprehension and tools that aide in this are likely to improve comprehension. Comprehension can also be improved by the reduction of mental effort. A simple application that allows you to annotate a PDF can improve your comprehension of a document by allowing you to focus on the important information. While a more complex solutions may use augmented reality (AR) or machine learning to aide in comprehension.
## Systems

#### Software Assistance

Common translation software such as google translate allows users to translate text on the fly allowing users to interact with languages that they do not know. Software that reads for a user (text to speech) can allow users who cannot interact with a website or document in a traditional way to comprehend the text. Dictation software provides similar benefits in allowing those who cannot type or write to do so. Software such as Obsidian also aides in comprehension by allowing users to link concepts together visualizing the relationships between them (building better situation models). [[Writing enhancement systems]] also have a role in improving comprehension by allowing a writer to more easily get their ideas onto a page.
#### Augmented Reality

AR combines the virtual and the real world, superimposing virtual elements onto physical objects  
this can be used to augment comprehension by increasing interaction or providing new ways to interact with a subject (Parmaxi & Demetriou, 2020). Much of the research in AR and reading comprehension is focused on its uses in [[Language learning applications]] be it adults learning a new language or children learning their first.  AR is often implemented using mobile devices (smartphones or tablets) but other technology such as wearables can potentially provide a more immersive AR experience thought at a higher cost.  Şimşek and Direkçi, (2023) investigated the use of AR with storybooks and how it effected students comprehension. They implemented AR as a application for a tablet that would allow users to interact with a textbook with their device. They found that overall comprehension of the books was improved by AR.

#### Machine Learning

AI powered tools have the potential to aide in language comprehension, either by providing summaries of documents or by identifying key ideas while currently AI performance in this is  unreliable It is likely it will improve quickly. AI powered tools also add accessibility options allowing media such as videos to be converted into a transcript or similar. 

Machine learning is also promising for translation and given time may allow for live translation.
