### Ethical Considerations and Limitations

// TODO: add content of other sub topics

Despite their transformative potential, [[Language Learning Applications]] present several ethical considerations and limitations. Privacy concerns arise as the learning systems collect extensive data on learner behaviours and performance. Additionally, the advanced language learning technology often remains inaccessible to disadvantaged economical populations, which may widen the educational gaps. Furthermore, over-reliance on algorithm feedback may lead to language assessments focus on easily measurable metrics rather than daily use.

Concerns surrounding [[Writing Enhancement Systems]] are similar, but more focused. The greatest concern all of these systems share is the possibility that with extensive use these tools will go from an aid that allows an individual to either grow their skill in writing or simply write a better paper to one that becomes necessary - something that the writer relies upon. There are also concerns about accessibility, but these concerns fall into the general issues with disadvantaged populations being unable to obtain or use the devices or internet connection required to use such technologies. As several of these systems are freely found online this imbalance is less bad with tools like Grammarly, but there still exist many barriers that can prevent individuals from even accessing these services without extra paywalls.

Furthermore, ethical concerns extend to multilingual models, and more specifically, [[Static Multilingual Systems]], which prioritize linguistic consistency and structured translations over adaptability. While these systems are essential for legal, medical, and corporate communication, their rigidity can reinforce linguistic biases and exclude linguistic diversity, particularly for underrepresented languages and dialects. Unlike adaptive models, static systems do not evolve with language shifts, which may lead to outdated terminology persisting in critical domains. Additionally, economic accessibility remains a concern, as high-quality static multilingual solutions are often embedded in proprietary enterprise platforms, making them inaccessible to smaller organizations or lower-income communities. Another challenge is over-reliance on pre-approved translation memory and rule-based structures, which, while ensuring precision, may overlook cultural nuance and idiomatic meaning in real-world multilingual interactions. Addressing these ethical concerns requires periodic linguistic updates, diversification of language datasets, and increased accessibility efforts to prevent static multilingual systems from reinforcing existing disparities in multilingual communication.
