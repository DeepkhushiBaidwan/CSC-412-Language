### Ethical Considerations and Limitations

// TODO: add content of other sub topics

Despite their transformative potential, [[Language Learning Applications]] present several ethical considerations and limitations. Privacy concerns arise as the learning systems collect extensive data on learner behaviours and performance. Additionally, the advanced language learning technology often remains inaccessible to disadvantaged economical populations, which may widen the educational gaps. Furthermore, over-reliance on algorithm feedback may lead to language assessments focus on easily measurable metrics rather than daily use.

Concerns surrounding [[Writing Enhancement Systems]] are similar, but more focused. The greatest concern all of these systems share is the possibility that with extensive use these tools will go from an aid that allows an individual to either grow their skill in writing or simply write a better paper to one that becomes necessary - something that the writer relies upon. There are also concerns about accessibility, but these concerns fall into the general issues with disadvantaged populations being unable to obtain or use the devices or internet connection required to use such technologies. As several of these systems are freely found online this imbalance is less bad with tools like Grammarly, but there still exist many barriers that can prevent individuals from even accessing these services without extra paywalls.

As with the other subsections [[Comprehension Augmentation Tools]] suffer from issues with data privacy and possible issues with accessibility (both physical and economical). In addition a system that comprehends for you (rather then just providing cognitive aids) will likely always suffer from bias in its comprehension based on how it was programmed or based on the data used in its training.

[[Multilingual Collaboration Systems]] present several ethical considerations, primarily around issues of inclusivity, privacy, and accuracy. These systems must ensure they are accessible to all users, regardless of language proficiency, and avoid biases that could arise from relying heavily on automated translations. Thereâ€™s also the potential for miscommunication due to nuances lost in translation, leading to misunderstandings. Furthermore, privacy concerns arise when sensitive data is processed through multilingual tools, especially if they involve third-party services. Ensuring that these systems uphold cultural sensitivity and are transparent about how data is handled are crucial limitations to address.
