Voice Synthesis is the System that synthesises text into human-comprehensible audio output. It is not as technically demanding as [[Automatic Speech Recognition]], but it is nonetheless essential to [[Dynamic Multilingual Collaboration Systems]] and incredibly valuable for human-machine interaction and communication. (Taylor, 2009) Simple speech can be achieved by recording the sound of each individual [phonetic letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) and mapping each to a letter or letter combination, with special rules depending on the language. However, achieving natural sounding speech is a bigger challenge. Certain improvements can be achieved by considering human tones and emotions, using artificial intelligence and mimicking human speech patterns. (Santen et al., 2013)
