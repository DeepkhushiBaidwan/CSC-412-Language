## Language Augmentation Systems

Language augmentation systems as a whole deal with enhancing human cognitive abilities related to language processing. These systems can be understood through two primary dimensions:

Processing Direction: Input (comprehension) vs. Output (production)

Application Context: Learning, collaboration, ethical implications

This document contains 5 sub-topics investigate from input-output relationships, learning context bridge, communication extensions to the critical framework, including:

* [[Comprehension Augmentation Tools]] (Input) and [[Writing Enhancement Systems]] (Output) represent complementary sides of language processing. Comprehension tools help users better understand language input and writing tools help users better produce language output. The advances in one area often influences the other like better understanding leads to better writing.

* [[Language Learning Applications]] bridge input and output processing as they often incorporate elements from both comprehension and writing enhancement systems. Usually those applications build comprehension capabilities(reading, listening) and develop production capabilities (writing, speaking).
  
* [[Multilingual Content Management]] extend language augmentation to multi-person contexts based on comprehension tools and writing enhancement to help users understand content in different languages, connecting to language learning by providing real-world practice environments.

- [[Multilingual Collaboration Systems]] enable a higher degree of interaction and collaboration in intercultural academic and corporate environments. They can be [Static](Static Multilingual Collaboration Systems), which are systems that require human interaction for full functionality, or [Dynamic](Dynamic Multilingual Collaboration Systems), which does not require any human operators.

* [[Ethical Considerations and Limitations]] provides a critical lens for all other topics such as questions equity of access to language learning technologies, considers cultural implications of multilingual systems and addresses concerns about writing and comprehension tools dependencies.
