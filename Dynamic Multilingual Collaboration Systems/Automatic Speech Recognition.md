Automatic Speech Recognition is the system that enables the processing of spoken language to text. The goal of this technology is for a machine to be able to understand and "act upon" spoken information. (Gaikwad et al., 2010) It allows for hands-free interaction with devices and can be used for a wide range of applications, like giving commands to home assistants, using for transcription services, and, most relevant to this research, for it's use in [translation](Multilingual Collaboration Systems). The underlying technology uses machine learning and neural networks to understand speech patterns, accents and context. (Yu & Deng, 2016)
