## Introduction

Dynamic multilingual collaboration systems are crucial in multilingual academic and corporate environments. They allow real-time translation, enabling faster cross-cultural cooperation. This is invaluable for any company and academic environment that has people from diverse cultural backgrounds, as it is faster, more versatile, and easier to find and implement that traditional translators, who may only be able to offer their services in a few languages, with prices going up the more languages offered. In contrast, Dynamic Multilingual Collaboration Systems offer a fixed price point and many times the number of languages a traditional translator service could offer.

## Cognitive Foundations

Speech-based communication is an essential tool for human cooperation and understanding. The possibility of expanding this ability inter-linguistically would enable cooperation within different languages. The process of verbal communication and the process of human translation are critical to understanding how these algorithms could enhance human cognition. Verbal communication is a complex process of encoding and decoding meaning, from sound waves to neural stimuli, and back again. While human translation does the same thing, it more layers: encoding from one language to the other, and potentially decoding cultural interpretation (e.g. jargon or sayings).
[[Static Multilingual Systems]] are the subsystem that encodes from one language to another, taking into account literal and cultural meaning. Dynamic systems however, do the speech-to-thought part of communication.
## Key Systems and Their Approaches

### Real-time Translation Interfaces
Dynamic Translation has three components:
- [[Automatic Speech Recognition]]
- Machine Translation (i.e. [[Static Multilingual Systems]])
- [[Voice Synthesis]]

Systems like Microsoft Teams Translator, Google Meet Translator, and Spoken Google Translate provide simultaneous translation of spoken communication, reducing barriers to real-time collaboration.
## Cognitive Impact

Dynamic multilingual collaboration systems can:

- Speed up translation when compared to traditional, non-technological translation services.

- Speed up translation when compared to [Static Systems](Static Multilingual Systems) with a human operator.

- Enable a greater degree of collaboration while reducing cognitive load

- Support cross-cultural communication and development.

## Future Directions

These systems are now largely integrated in video calling and mobile applications, but a major improvement area for these is real-time, in-person translation, through technologies like earphone translation (often compared to [Babel Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Future_predictions)) and virtual or augmented reality. There are some technical constraints on speed for this technology due to different languages using differing [Subject-Verb-Object Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order), which would mean someone speaking English would have to wait for someone speaking Greek to finish their sentence before hearing the verb. This means that within these languages, translation can't be in real time word-to-word, but rather sentence-to-sentence, which could be a challenge and source of frustration with the products when talking to other people in corporate environments.
